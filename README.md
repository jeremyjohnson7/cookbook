# CS 3630 â€“ Final Project Web-App

This project is the front-end for the cookbook application. To run on `localhost`, it expects [`cookbook_api`](https://github.com/jeremyjohnson7/cookbook_api) to be running on port `localhost:3080`.

Before starting this application, start the API, [`cookbook_api`](https://github.com/jeremyjohnson7/cookbook_api).

To start the application, run

```
$ npm start
```

Note that an API key is required to access the data from the back-end.
